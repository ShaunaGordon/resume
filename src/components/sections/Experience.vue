                            Proof Group uses a novel twist on keeping human resources on a contract/retainer basis, which they call an affiliate program. The program consists of a pool of consultants with various skillsets who work on a project basis. This is different from conventional contracting in some subtle, but important ways. The affiliate pool consists of true consultants, in a business-to-business type of relationship (so the affiliates are free to pick up projects based on their terms and work when and where they choose, so long as the work they agreed to do gets done), but with the ability to collaborate with one another and with key contacts of the core company team. To be an affiliate is to have an ongoing business-to-business relationship as a vendor to the company.

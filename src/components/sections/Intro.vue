            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                I'm a problem-solver by nature and by profession. I have a natural drive to find solutions to problems spoken and unspoken. By digging down through pain points, I excel in finding the heart of issues and coming up with the best solution.
            </p>
            <p>
                While I currently specialize in PHP, I always enjoy learning new things, and currently have my sights set particularly on Go and Elixir programming, and diving deeper into Linux system administration and container management.

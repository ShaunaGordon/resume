            <p>
                I'm a problem-solver by nature and by profession. I have a natural drive to find solutions to problems spoken and unspoken. By digging down through pain points, I excel in finding the heart of issues and coming up with the best solution within the constraints of the environment.
            </p>
            <p>
                While I've historically specialized in PHP, I always enjoy learning new things, and am currently deep-diving into the world of Python, and have my sights set on Go and Elixir in the near future, as well as diving deeper into Linux system administration and container management.

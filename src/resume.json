However, the interim solution that had been implemented was very manual and cumbersome. I collaborated with several engineering managers of other teams to come up with and orchestrate the implementation of an automated notification system.<br>As part of a long-term, cross-team initiative, we came up with a plan to use Github pull requests to provide the content and the trigger of a notification that would describe in plain language what the change was doing and why, the level of risk for the deploy, and link to supplemental outputs of the development process (including the issue tracking item, project pitches, architectural decision records, Slack discussions, and anything else relevant). The automated system was then intended to take the pull request contents, display a portion of it on a unified dashboard, with a link to the full pull request for technical stakeholders, and send an email out to those who wanted it.<br>As of the time of my departure, we had taken several steps to bringing the pull requests into alignment with this vision, including working out with a broader collection of engineers a \"bring your own process\" for assessing the risk of a change while using the same output chart to serve as a common \"language\" to stakeholders, and were evaluating our existing tools and past projects to see what existing work we could leverage in this new vision.",

That was mainly around our state of documentation at the time (multiple, siloed knowledge bases of varying quality), technical debt problems, and occasional change management issues. We often bounced ideas off each other and I always found her opinions and feedback insightful. I also appreciated the ideas she brought to wider engineering discussions at things like all-hands, hack-a-thons, and show & tell. She's not afraid to speak up about what she cares about, a quality I wish more engineers had to be honest. <br>As for Shauna's engineering skills, I know she wasn't afraid to dive deep into the systems (some being *very* \"legacy\") that her team owned, to figure out a solution for the project at hand. The tech stack there was typically Ruby on Rails and React, both she's highly skilled in. I think any company would be lucky to have Shana on board and I highly recommend her."
